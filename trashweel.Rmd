# Results and discussion
## The regression equation
for the simple model (final_trash) predicting the log of weight based on different trash categories is as follows:
log ‚Å° ( Weight ) = 1.133 ‚àí 0.00001963 √ó PlasticBottles ‚àí 0.00002926 √ó Polystyrene + 0.00000309 √ó CigaretteButts ‚àí 0.001765 √ó GlassBottles + 0.00004400 √ó PlasticBags ‚àí 0.00004355 √ó Wrappers + 0.002846 √ó SportsBalls 

### Model Comparison
Two regression models were used to predict the log-transformed weight of trash: the simpler model (final_trash) and the more complex model (final_season) that includes an additional variable for seasons. Simple Model (final_trash): The simple model explained a small proportion of the variance in the log-transformed weight of trash, with an adjusted R-squared of 0.1506. The model had a significant F-statistic, ùêπ ( 7 , 985 ) = 26.12 F(7,985)=26.12, ùëù < 2.2 ùëí ‚àí 16 p<0.001, suggesting that the included variables were collectively significant predictors. Among the variables, PlasticBottles, Polystyrene, CigaretteButts, PlasticBags, Wrappers, and SportsBalls were significant predictors of log-transformed weight. GlassBottles, however, was not a significant predictor (p = 0.11661). Complex Model (final_season): The more complex model, which also includes the variable Season, accounted for a slightly larger proportion of variance in the log-transformed weight of trash, with an adjusted R-squared of 0.1564. The model's overall fit was significant, with ùêπ ( 10 , 982 ) = 19.39 F(10,982)=19.39, ùëù < 0,001. In this model, PlasticBottles, Polystyrene, CigaretteButts, PlasticBags, Wrappers, and SportsBalls remained significant, similar to the simple model. Additionally, SeasonSpring and SeasonSummer were found to be significant predictors, with SeasonAutumn showing no significant effect (p = 0.216571). 

### Model Fit and Complexity 

Although the complex model explains slightly more variance in the dependent variable (log-transformed weight of trash), with an adjusted R-squared increase from 0.1506 to 0.1564, the improvement is relatively small. This suggests that while seasonality may have a small effect on the weight of trash, the inclusion of season variables doesn't significantly improve the model compared to the simpler one.

## Conclusion

The simple model (final_trash) is preferred due to the simplicity and the fact that the addition of seasonal information in the complex model (final_season) does not substantially increase the explanatory power of the model. Removing the seasonality factor does not negatively impact the model's predictive accuracy much, making the simpler model an effective choice in this case.
